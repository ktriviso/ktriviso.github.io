            <h2>Founder and Head Coach</h2>

            <div id="information-container">

                <h3>Coach Biography</h3>
                <p>Paul grew up in a small town in Pennsylvania, where there was not much else to do but play sports, and that’s what he did. Being so involved with sports and fitness throughout his teenage years, he decided to pursue a career in the fitness industry. He received a Bachelor’s degree in Exercise Science and a Master’s in Exercise Physiology, and during that time, he fell in love with coaching and training for CrossFit, which he has been doing ever since.
                <br><br>
                Paul has an obsessive passion for learning the latest techniques in strength and conditioning, and using them to help others achieve their goals. Coming from a very research-based education, he believes that anecdotal evidence or the “it worked for him so everyone should do it” methods are not good enough reasons to create training programs around. That’s why Paul bases his knowledge on scientifically researched and well-tested protocols.
                <br><br>
                Paul spends his time as a coach at CrossFit Outbreak in Brooklyn, New York, coaching classes and designing training programs for general population clients and competitive athletes alike. Paul himself is a high level competitive CrossFit athlete, so he understands what it’s like to be the athlete and the coach, which he believes gives him an advantage over other coaches who do not realize the challenges that athletes are faced with on a daily basis.

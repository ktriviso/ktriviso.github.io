		<h2>Coding Goals</h2>
		<p>Through the completion of Front-end Developemnt Course at General Assembly, I would like to obtain enough knowledge to become accepted into an immersive course. I wish to become profficent in other coding languages such as React in order to become a well-rounded, self-employed web developer within the next year.</p>

		<h2>Current Questions</h2>
		<p>
			<ol>
				<li>Correct spacing and indentations of coding within HTML so that everything is perfectly nested.</li>
				<li>I am confused about padding/margin, etc. I have ran across issues with no being able to size a photo properly. I am looking forward to going over this.</li>
				<li>Still finding Github to be slightly confusing and Im already unsure if I submitted the homework properly</li>
				<li>I would like to learn more about communicating through the terminal</li>
				<li>If I use a website as  my final project, will the site be secured? I am concerned because this will be a real site for a non-profit, still awaiting trademarks and rights for the compnay's name, logo, etc.</li>
